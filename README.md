# MintMarket

**A Fair and Sustainable NFT Marketplace**

## About the Project
MintMarket is an NFT exchange platform designed to empower both collectors and creators. It offers a seamless way for users to purchase, sell, and own digital collectibles.

**Key Philosophy:**
Every NFT serves as a digital memento or asset, uploaded directly by artists. To support the creative community, MintMarket implements a royalty system where a percentage of each resale automatically goes back to the original artist. This ensures a fair and sustainable digital art ecosystem, allowing creators to continue earning from their work as it gains value, while collectors truly own their assets.

The project focuses on building a robust marketplace for transactions between buyers and sellers, visually demonstrated using a simulated blockchain environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A local server environment (like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP) to run PHP and MySQL (for full functionality).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikashs26/MintMarket.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MintMarket
   ```

### Running the Application
- **Frontend Only**: You can view the static pages by opening `index.html` directly in your browser.
- **Full Application**: Move the project files to your local server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP) and access it via `localhost`.
